
there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it  a dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two were using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and the talking over its head very uncomfortable for the dormouse thought alice only as its asleep i suppose it doesnt mind

the table was a large one but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it  no room no room they cried out when they saw alice coming theres plenty of room said alice indignantly and she sat down in a large arm chair at one end of the table

have some wine the march hare said in an encouraging tone

alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it but tea i dont see any wine she remarked

there isnt any said the march hare

then it wasnt very civil of you to offer it said alice angrily

it wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being invited said the march hare

i didnt know it was your table said alice its laid for a great many more than three

your hair wants cutting said the hatter he had been looking at alice for some time with great curiosity and this was his first speech

you should learn not to make personal remarks alice said with some severity its very rude

the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said was why is a raven like a writing desk

come we shall have some fun now thought alice im glad theyve begun asking riddles  i believe i can guess that she added aloud

do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it said the march hare

exactly so said alice

then you should say what you mean the march hare went on

i do alice hastily replied at least  at least i mean what i say  thats the same thing you know

not the same thing a bit said the hatter you might just as well say that i see what i eat is the same thing as i eat what i see

you might just as well say added the march hare that i like what i get is the same thing as i get what i like

you might just as well say added the dormouse who seemed to be talking in his sleep that i breathe when i sleep is the same thing as i sleep when i breathe

it is the same thing with you said the hatter and here the conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute while alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing desks which wasnt much

the hatter was the first to break the silence what day of the month is it he said turning to alice  he had taken his watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking it every now and then and holding it to his ear

alice considered a little and then said the fourth

two days wrong sighed the hatter i told you butter wouldnt suit the works he added looking angrily at the march hare

it was the best butter the march hare meekly replied

yes but some crumbs must have got in as well the hatter grumbled  you shouldnt have put it in with the bread knife

the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily  then he dipped it into his cup of tea and looked at it again  but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark it was the best butter you know

alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity what a funny watch she remarked it tells the day of the month and doesnt tell what oclock it is

why should it muttered the hatter does your watch tell you what year it is

of course not alice replied very readily  but thats because it stays the same year for such a long time together

which is just the case with mine said the hatter

alice felt dreadfully puzzled the hatters remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly english i dont quite understand you she said as politely as she could

the dormouse is asleep again said the hatter and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose

the dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its eyes of course of course just what i was going to remark myself

have you guessed the riddle yet the hatter said turning to alice again

no i give it up alice replied  thats the answer

i havent the slightest idea said the hatter

nor i said the march hare

alice sighed wearily i think you might do something better with the time she said than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers

if you knew time as well as i do said the hatter you wouldnt talk about wasting it its him

i dont know what you mean said alice

of course you dont the hatter said tossing his head contemptuously i dare say you never even spoke to time

perhaps not alice cautiously replied  but i know i have to beat time when i learn music

ah that accounts for it said the hatter he wont stand beating now if you only kept on good terms with him hed do almost anything you liked with the clock for instance suppose it were nine oclock in the morning just time to begin lessons  youd only have to whisper a hint to time and round goes the clock in a twinkling half past one time for dinner

i only wish it was the march hare said to itself in a whisper

that would be grand certainly said alice thoughtfully  but then  i shouldnt be hungry for it you know

not at first perhaps said the hatter  but you could keep it to half past one as long as you liked

is that the way you manage alice asked

the hatter shook his head mournfully not i he replied we quarrelled last march  just before he went mad you know   pointing with his tea spoon at the march hare   it was at the great concert given by the queen of hearts and i had to sing

twinkle twinkle little bat how i wonder what youre at

you know the song perhaps

ive heard something like it said alice

it goes on you know the hatter continued in this way   

up above the world you fly like a tea tray in the sky twinkle twinkle  

here the dormouse shook itself and began singing in its sleep twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle   and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop

well id hardly finished the first verse said the hatter when the queen jumped up and bawled out hes murdering the time off with his head

how dreadfully savage exclaimed alice

and ever since that the hatter went on in a mournful tone he wont do a thing i ask its always six oclock now

a bright idea came into alices head is that the reason so many tea things are put out here she asked

yes thats it said the hatter with a sigh  its always tea time and weve no time to wash the things between whiles

then you keep moving round i suppose said alice

exactly so said the hatter  as the things get used up

but what happens when you come to the beginning again alice ventured to ask

suppose we change the subject the march hare interrupted yawning im getting tired of this i vote the young lady tells us a story

im afraid i dont know one said alice rather alarmed at the proposal

then the dormouse shall they both cried wake up dormouse and they pinched it on both sides at once

the dormouse slowly opened his eyes i wasnt asleep he said in a hoarse feeble voice  i heard every word you fellows were saying

tell us a story said the march hare

yes please do pleaded alice

and be quick about it added the hatter or youll be asleep again before its done

once upon a time there were three little sisters the dormouse began in a great hurry and their names were elsie lacie and tillie and they lived at the bottom of a well  

what did they live on said alice who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking

they lived on treacle said the dormouse after thinking a minute or two

they couldnt have done that you know alice gently remarked theyd have been ill

so they were said the dormouse very ill

alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like but it puzzled her too much so she went on  but why did they live at the bottom of a well

take some more tea the march hare said to alice very earnestly

ive had nothing yet alice replied in an offended tone so i cant take more

you mean you cant take less said the hatter  its very easy to take more than nothing

nobody asked your opinion said alice

whos making personal remarks now the hatter asked triumphantly

alice did not quite know what to say to this  so she helped herself to some tea and bread and butter and then turned to the dormouse and repeated her question why did they live at the bottom of a well

the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it and then said it was a treacle well

theres no such thing alice was beginning very angrily but the hatter and the march hare went sh sh and the dormouse sulkily remarked if you cant be civil youd better finish the story for yourself

no please go on alice said very humbly i wont interrupt again i dare say there may be one

one indeed said the dormouse indignantly however he consented to go on and so these three little sisters  they were learning to draw you know  

what did they draw said alice quite forgetting her promise

treacle said the dormouse without considering at all this time

i want a clean cup interrupted the hatter  lets all move one place on

he moved on as he spoke and the dormouse followed him  the march hare moved into the dormouses place and alice rather unwillingly took the place of the march hare the hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change  and alice was a good deal worse off than before as the march hare had just upset the milk jug into his plate

alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again so she began very cautiously  but i dont understand where did they draw the treacle from

you can draw water out of a water well said the hatter so i should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle well  eh stupid

but they were in the well alice said to the dormouse not choosing to notice this last remark

of course they were said the dormouse   well in

this answer so confused poor alice that she let the dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it

they were learning to draw the dormouse went on yawning and rubbing its eyes for it was getting very sleepy and they drew all manner of things  everything that begins with an m  

why with an m said alice

why not said the march hare

alice was silent

the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going off into a doze but on being pinched by the hatter it woke up again with a little shriek and went on    that begins with an m such as mouse traps and the moon and memory and muchness   you know you say things are much of a muchness  did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness

really now you ask me said alice very much confused i dont think  

then you shouldnt talk said the hatter

this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear  she got up in great disgust and walked off the dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that they would call after her  the last time she saw them they were trying to put the dormouse into the teapot

at any rate ill never go there again said alice as she picked her way through the wood its the stupidest tea party i ever was at in all my life

just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it thats very curious she thought but everythings curious today i think i may as well go in at once and in she went

once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table now ill manage better this time she said to herself and began by taking the little golden key and unlocking the door that led into the garden then she wet to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her pocked till she was about a foot high  then she walked down the little passage  and then  she found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright flower beds and the cool fountains
